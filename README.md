# Stock_Market_Prediction_using_Python
This is a Machine Learning Project in which we can predict the price of the stock of any company by giving a dataset. In this project, we implemented five different models and found the best one. We used Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest, Decision Tree & and KNN. Using this model we can predict that if we buy stock at opening price and sell it at closing price how much profit or loss we can get. The model is useful for Traders as well as investors.
